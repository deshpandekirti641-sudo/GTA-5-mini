# Mini GTA-5 – India Version

This directory contains everything for the India map/game version.  
It is independent: all assets, scripts, scenes, and configs are here.

## How to Run

1. Open `project.godot` (or `project.unity`) in your game engine.
2. All India-specific content is under `assets/`, `scenes/`, `scripts/`.

## Directory Structure

- `assets/` – Characters, costumes, VFX, SFX, Indian environments
- `scenes/` – Godot/Unity scenes for India
- `scripts/` – Game logic for this version

## Notes

- If you need to use anything from `shared_libs/`, reference it in your scripts.
- For support or issues, contact the maintainer listed in the root `README.md`.
